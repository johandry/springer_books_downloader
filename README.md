# Download Free Machine Learning and Data books from Springer

The following post release 65 links of free books from Springer about Machine Learning and Data. There is a total of 408 books but this python script just download the 65 curated books about Machine Learning and Data.

To get them, just clone the repo and execute:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
mkdir books
./downloader.py
```

This script uses Python 3, so in my computer it's named `python3` same as `pip3` for pip. If yours is different just change the shebang and the pip install line.

Enjoy the books!

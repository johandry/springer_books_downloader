There is a total of 408 books released but this python script just download these 65 curated books.

To get them, just clone the repo and execute:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt
./downloader.py
```

The post was downloaded to the file `springer-has-released-65-machine-learning-and-data-books-for-free.html` and all the downloaded books are stored in the `./books` directory.

This script uses Python 3, in my computer it's named `python3` same as `pip3` for pip. If yours is different just change the shebang and the pip install line above.

Enjoy the books!
